The process for updating documentation is applicable across all modules and is as follows:

1) First make the necessary changes in the word documents in this directory.

	a) Rule of thumb:
		Examples are useful.
		Update any new methods in the methods section
		Update any new XML attributes in the attributes section
		New insights - document what you have learned.  examples help.
		Document what to do when errors occur - give examples.
		Don't put customer specific hostnames, IP address etc in your docs.  Generalize it.
		For VCS, there is a new section at the end where specific details can be added for a particular VCS.

	b) Update the Month and Date on the cover page

	c) Update the version history with your name, date and brief description of the change

	d) Update the Table of Contents
		i) Right click in the table of contents and select "Update Field"

		ii) Select "Update entire table"

		iii) Click OK


2) If updating VCS, make sure to consider if the doc changes affect both PDTool and PDToolStudio
	
	a) if changes affect both, then you will need to update

		PDTool doc: Composite PS Promotion and Deployment Tool Module - Version Control System v2.3.doc

		PDToolStudio doc: /VCS_Studio/Composite PS Promotion and Deployment Tool Studio VCS Integration v2.2.doc

3) Save the word document changes

4) Save as PDF
	a) Select "Save As"

	b) Browse to ../docs

	c) Select the PDF document that corresponds to the word document that you are modifying

	d) Note: if PDToolStudio, then go to VCS_Studio and select "Composite PS Promotion and Deployment Tool Studio VCS Integration v2.2.pdf"

	e) Save

	f) A PDF document will pop up.  Simply Exit this document as it is already saved.

	g) Close the word document.   Select Save.

5) Check-in code and docs
